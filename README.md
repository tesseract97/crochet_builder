This is an image processing project that will take an image and return a crochet pattern where each pixel is a color in order to make colorwork easier. 

Initially, this project is just intended for pixilart projects with a small number of pixels, but inevitably will expand to finding a palette for each image and deconstructing more advanced images.

The first image to be deconstructed with by this basic desert pixilart image:
